# E-G Cart 🛒
**A smart in-store grocery companion for seamless shopping.**

---

## 📖 Project Overview
**E‑G Cart** is an Android application designed to help shoppers navigate supermarkets efficiently. By scanning a QR code on a smart cart, users can access real‑time store maps, search for items, and see exact shelf locations. 

As a student project, this focuses on solving the common "wandering" problem in large stores, providing a digital layer to the physical shopping experience.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Interactive Store Map:** Visualize the layout of the supermarket and pinpoint items instantly.
* **Smart Search:** Find products by name or category with aisle and shelf-level precision.
* **Indoor Positioning:** For supported stores, the app tracks the cart’s live position and calculates the shortest route through the aisles.
* **Real-Time Data:** View up-to-date pricing and alternative product suggestions synced with the store’s inventory.
* **Privacy-First:** No accounts or personal data collection. Search history and preferences stay on your device.

## ⚠️ Technical Notes & Constraints
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Hardware Synchronization:** The real-time mapping and indoor positioning functionality require the hardware to be properly set up such as UWB Tag and Anchor. If the hardware has not been configured or the QR code is not linked to a valid cart ID, these features will be disabled.

## 🔒 Privacy Policy
E-G Cart is designed with user privacy as a priority:
- **No Online Accounts:** No registration required.
- **Local Storage Only:** Search history and optional usernames are stored exclusively on the user's device.
- **No Data Harvesting:** Personal information (name, address, contacts) is never collected or uploaded to external servers.
